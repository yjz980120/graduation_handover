V3DNeuron2: An integrated Neuron Tracer.

--- How to build.

This package contains both the Vaa3D plugin for neuron tracing as well as the 
standalone programs of neuron tracing. 

In most cases, one will only need to build the Vaa3D neuron tracing plugin. To
do that, simple qmake followed by make. Then you can run Vaa3D (in either the 
menu mode or command line mode) to trace neurons.

If needed, one can always enter the respective "app1", "app2", or "neuron_radius" 
folders to run "qmake", or "make" to build the standalone programs.
